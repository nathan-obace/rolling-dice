Rolling Dice Game

Welcome to Rolling Dice, a two-player game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to reach a score of 100 before your opponent does. Players take turns rolling a pair of dice and accumulating points. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their turn and the other player gets a chance to play.
How to Play

    To start the game, simply click the "Roll Dice" button.
    The total of the dice roll will be displayed on the screen.
    If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and their score remains unchanged. The other player now gets to roll the dice.
    If a player rolls any number other than 1, they can choose to "Hold" their score and add it to their total points for the game.
    Play continues in this manner until one player reaches a score of 100 or more points.
